The RSCVD initiative is made possible by the generous help of volunteers around the world. We sincerely thank and appreciate volunteers for their time, expertise and resources. If you wish to join in volunteering for the initiative, please contact [ifladdrs@gmail.com](mailto:ifladdrs@gmail.com).

Thanks also goes to the [IFLA DDRS Standing Committee members](https://www.ifla.org/standing-committee/15) for providing their expertise in starting, promoting and subsequently providing their resources for the initiative.

Finally, Joe McArthur and the [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org) have provided valuable support on creating the website and the request form using [InstantILL](htttps://instantill.org). The Open Access Button allows librarians to find materials they are looking for even without making a request.
